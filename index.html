Using const or let to declare variables, as appropriate.
Fixing syntax errors, such as missing closing parentheses and semicolons.
Using the === operator to check for equality, instead of the = assignment operator.
Creating separate variables for the months where holidays occur.
Incrementing count using the += operator instead of let count = count + X.
Removing unnecessary parentheses in holiday names. -->
